# Toe spread

## Internal and external toe spread over time  

**Aim:** This study aimed at evaluating the toe spread following experimental treatments of the sciatic nerve in mouse.   

**Study design:** The sciatic nerve was either exposed to crush injury (n=7), crush injury and kolchicin (n=7) or NaCl (n=7). The internal and external toe spread was measured from 7 days prior to injury to 20 days post injury (1-2 days between measurements). Five random images of the paws were selected for each animal and time point. The internal and external toe spread was measured in the right and left paw (one side serving as control). Hence a total of 20 measures were gathered for each animal and time point.
